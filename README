Turing Machine

A Turing Machine implementation in python with a program that generates an interactive state machine from a given Turing Machine using python's Tkinter library.
See 
www.drogers.us/demos/turing_machine/ 
for information and a demonstration of the usage of the Turing Machine programs.

For running commandline or Tkinter gui applications, cd into src/tm/ and run 
python turing_machine.py -h
or
python tm_state_machine.py -h

for help.  Note that this source is a Pydev Eclipse project, and can be imported into Eclipse if you have Pydev.
