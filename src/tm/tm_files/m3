## Turing machine input file
# pound is a comment if first in line
# and comments can be anywhere (whole line)

# blank lines are ignored

## the first section of the input can initialize
# everything but the delta functions, in any order
# once the delta functions are started, the file
# must have only delta functions, blank lines, or comments

# in the initialization, any attribute of the TM class
# is initialized by name as an exec statement in python 
# except for tape_alphabets which uses that name
# if in doubt, just use this file as a template, modifying
# rhs values as necessary

# description is a string, optional 
description = "{ w : w ends with a 1 }"

# alphabet is the input alphabet
alphabet 		= [('0'), ('1')]

# blank_symbol is the symbol for the blank character
# on all tapes
blank_symbol	= Symbol('B')

# how many tapes in machine
num_tapes		= 1

# specify an alphabet for each tape, with the input tape being
# first, or the only one, if single tape machine
#### explain more about symbol initialization, both here and with input alphabet
tape_alphabets	= 
[
[('B'), ('0'), ('1')]
]

# designated states
# start state is always q0
# once the machine knows the accept and reject states
# you can refer to them either by q+number or q+'_reject', q+'_accept', etc
accept_state = "q1"
reject_state = "q2"

## delta functions

# note that reject states are unnecessary, they will be generated

q0 0    q0 0 r
q0 1    q0 1 r
q0 B    q3 B l

q3 0    qreject 0 r
q3 1    qaccept 1 r
q3 B    qreject B l
